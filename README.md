SemaJS is a simple Javascript library that you can use in your 
projects to generate greetings(formal and informal).

Implements chainable methods that make your code more simple and elegant. Uses the internationally recognized language acronyms(i.e ENG, SWA). You are invited to go through the code to learn more about the methods the library provides. 

It is super-compatible with jQuery, I actually recommend using it along jQuery.

Currently supports English and Swahili but more languages are on the way.
